Framework
Next.js 16 (App Router)
Built-in React Compiler (no more useMemo) and stable Turbopack for instant HMR.
Language
TypeScript 5.x+
Using strictest mode. 2026 features include better Auto-Imports and Type-Stripping for faster builds.
Styling
Tailwind CSS v4
A zero-runtime, CSS-first engine. Uses Container Queries natively for truly responsive components.
UI Library
shadcn/ui + Radix
The industry standard for accessible, headless components that you "own" in your source code.
State/Data
TanStack Query v6
Handles server-state (caching, retries) with full TypeScript inference from your API routes.
Database/Backend
Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Provides PostgREST for auto-generated types and pgvector for AI/Search capabilities.
ORM / Query
Drizzle ORM
A "TypeScript-first" ORM. It's lighter than Prisma and maps 1:1 with SQL, providing perfect type safety.
Validation
Zod / Valibot
Schema validation that doubles as your TypeScript type definitions for API inputs/outputs.
Tooling
Biome
A single Rust-based tool that replaces ESLint and Prettier. It is 25x faster than the old stack.

Primary Font
Noto Sans KR
High-density Hangul legibility. Use the Variable weight for performance.
Code/UI Mono
Geist Mono
Designed by Vercel for maximum readability in data-heavy UIs.
Iconography
Phosphor Icons
Use "Thin" or "Light" weights (e.g., <Horse weight="thin" />) to maintain a premium feel.
Emoji Policy
Strict Zero-Emoji
Use Phosphor icons in semantic colors (e.g., a blue "Info" icon instead of ℹ️) to keep the brand professional.
